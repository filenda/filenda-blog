A high price-to-rent ratio typically suggests that buying a home is more expensive than renting, indicating that it might be a better time to rent rather than buy. Conversely, a low price-to-rent ratio suggests that buying a home is relatively cheaper compared to renting, potentially signaling a better time to purchase property.

## MicroSaaS

In short, micro saas are tiny pieces of monetized software that are charged on a recurrent monthly basis, such as browser plugins or chatbots that operate on a specific domain, such as a restaurant, for example.

Also, microsaas communities are on the rise worldwide, such as:

- In tech, we went full gas pedal on moving from monoliths (i.e big software pieces all together) to microservices (separate and distributed pieces of software) but later found out that it could not be the silver bullet for all tech scenarios…
